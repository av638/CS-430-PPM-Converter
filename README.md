# CS-430-PPM-Converter

In this ppm converter you can run it through gcc
and pass in the the file type that you want the image to 
be converted to(6 or 3). You can then pass in the name of the image to be converted 
as well as the name of what you would like the output file to be called.
This program will Properly read in both file formats as well as write out the 
P3 format properly but for some reason anytime I try and write out to P6 the colors
get a little messed up. I do not know why this is occuring and I cant figure it out because
I am not actually messing with the colors, I am just grabbing the data and writing it out with
fwrite. Besides this the program works just fine.
